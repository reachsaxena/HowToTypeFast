            <h2>How to type </h2>

            <p>
                Most people use a techinque called home row.The home row is 
                most the basic way to type 70+ wpm (words per minute). Alot off people 
                use home row and they can get 100+ wpm(words per minute). You don't have
                to use home row to get 70+ wpm(words per minute) , I don't use home row and 
                I get 60-70 wpm(words per minute).Before you start you should
                take a typeing test to compaer before and after.A wedsite
                that I like useing is called <a target="_blank" href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkey type</a>.
                When you finsh all the lessons you should revist monkey type and 
                take another typeing test.
